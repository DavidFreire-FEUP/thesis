First, I thank my supervisor, Cláudio Monteiro, for his patience, creativity, guidance, friendship, and trust. Developing this work with him is an experience that I will never forget.

I want to thank my colleagues at Enlitia, Isabel Preto, João Pereira, and Filipe Fialho, for their daily support, invaluable feedback on the methodology and presentation, and all our informal, fun, and stress-relieving moments.

To the CEO of Enlitia, Tiago Santos, thank you for the incredible opportunity to work with you and allow this thesis to happen in an industrial setting, offering me access to all the required data.

I thank my dear friend Diogo Landau for helping me review this document, showing interest in my work, and posing valuable questions about the methodology.

Finally, I would like to thank my pillars. To my parents, Lucinda Moreira and Ilídio Freire, thank you for the unconditional support in everything, giving me the privilege of deciding my education path at FEUP. To my partner, Sara Abreu, thank you for being there for me no matter the circumstances, making hard times easier to endure.
