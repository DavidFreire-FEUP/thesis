%\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Agradecimentos}

I would first like to start off by thanking my supervisor Professor Jorge
Barbosa, who made himself available to not only clarify my questions, but also
for his valuable guidance in choosing between development alternatives.

I would like to thank my work colleagues, and especially Fernando Gomes. The
freedom in solution approach and the tools you made available brought my work
to a higher level. 

I would also like to thank my friend, Dr. Xavier Andrade for having
extensively reviewed this document and provided valuable insights.

To my parents, Maria Jo√£o Carrapato and Jorge Landau, thank you for your
patient and unconditional support, and to my sister, Beatriz Landau, thank you
being my source of inspiration.
