\section{Context} \label{sec:context}

The XIX century represents a substantial change in how the world perceives
energy resources, characterized by the urge to invest in renewable energy to 
power modern societies. Although these relatively modern alternatives are
proving to be both cost-efficient and environmentally friendly, they also come
with many other unprecedented issues.
Some of these issues are reflected by their intermittent nature, complex
forecasting, geographic-dependant operating conditions, complex power
electronics interface, etc.

As independent power producers become more frequent, it's in the grid operator's
interest that these issues are as attenuated as possible, which has led to the
continuous development of specialized algorithms and control structures.
Therefore, many complex processes need to be implemented to reduce uncertainties
in the aforementioned problems, which mostly come in the form of
mathematical/statistical methodologies, machine learning and deep learning
applications.

Parting from the three general problem-solving principles mentioned, machine
learning and deep learning are proving to be the most popular and successful
ones for recent applications that ought to solve complex problems. Such
potential leads to interest in their application to the renewable energy sector.

\section{Motivation} \label{sec:motivation}

Given the widespread increase in the construction of PV (Photovoltaic) farms, there
comes a need to maintain these facilities operational and yielding at maximum
efficiency. For that to be achieved, a series of algorithms must be executed
routinely to maintain the state estimation of a farm, as it is
desirable to know if any action must be taken to restore or fix components from
an anomalous scenario. Detecting and predicting component faults allows the
responsible agents to perform reparative or preventive maintenance on the
equipment as soon as possible, which in turn minimizes any potential losses by
increasing system availability.

With the continuous effort of integrating intermittent energy resources into
modern electric grids, the requirements for connecting such power systems have
been increasingly stricter to maintain safe grid operating conditions.
Consequently, companies that either possess or plan to build photovoltaic farms
must comply with these requirements, which not only come with the need for adequate
power electronics but also monitoring/control capability.
\textcolor{red}{(INSERT SOURCES!)}
Since system faults can incur unpredicted electrical production behavior,
sanctions or fines might be applied to the responsible party. Being aware of
that, the mentioned preventive maintenance can be critical to minimize
potential disturbance propagation to the grid, and avoid the
corresponding fines.

\section{Goals} \label{sec:goals}

The main scope of this paper is to apply deep learning techniques to diagnose
the operation of PV farms. It is desired to achieve the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Identify and study the existing fault prediction/detection tools;
  \item Adapt and/or develop a new tool based on distributed architecture AI;
  \item Apply and test the new tool on a real case study;
  \item Validate methodologies through benchmarking and reference tools.
\end{itemize}
