Photovoltaic generation components, the internal layout and the ac collection grid are being investigated for ensuring the best design, operation and control of these power plants. This paper addresses the review of components as photovoltaic panels, converters and transformers utilized in large scale photovoltaic power plants.

   abstract = {Solar energy has increased in its share of global electrical energy production. The increasing reliability of solar energy has positively affected the sustainability of photovoltaic (PV) power plants. A failure in any module in the plant can reduce or interrupt the production of electrical energy, causing significant losses in both efficiency and asset value. Therefore, responding to a fault as quickly as possible in a PV power plant is critical. The ability of the PV plant operator to react to potential faults is directly related to the rapid detection of faulty modules. In this paper, different PV monitoring systems in the literature are investigated extensively from the point of view of the devices and the techniques used to measure PV systems' current, voltage, solar radiation, and module temperature. In particular, the communication methods and data acquisition cards used in monitoring were examined. Remote monitoring technologies quickly detect the location of a malfunction in a large-scale power plant. In this context, traditional wire communication methods, today's communication technologies, and the low-cost IoT (Internet of Things) technologies used to monitor the performance of large and small-scale PV power plants are compared in detail. With the advancement of Internet of Things technologies such as Zigbee and LoRa, research on remote wireless monitoring of photovoltaic modules has accelerated in recent years. These technologies are projected to be widely deployed in the near future for the maintenance and fault detection of numerous photovoltaic installations.},

They generalize graphs, simplicial complexes, and polyhedral complexes that form important domains for practical applications. They also provide a combinatorial formalism that allows the inclusion of complicated relationships of restrictive structures such as graphs and meshes. In this paper, we propose Cell Complexes Neural Networks (CXNs), a general, combinatorial and unifying construction for performing neural network-type computations on cell complexes. We introduce an inter-cellular message passing scheme on cell complexes that takes the topology of the underlying space into account and generalizes message passing scheme to graphs. Finally, we introduce a unified cell complex encoder-decoder framework that enables learning representation of cells for a given complex inside the Eucli-dean spaces. In particular, we show how our cell complex autoencoder construction can give, in the special case cell2vec, a generalization for node2vec.},

   abstract = {With the exponential growth in global photovoltaic (PV) power capacity, protection of PV systems has gained prodigious importance in last few decades. Even with the use of standard protection devices in a PV system, faults occurring in a PV array may remain undetected. Inspired by the ever increasing demand for a reliable fault detection technique, several advanced techniques have been proposed in literature; especially in the last few years. Hence, this paper carries out an in depth analysis of various fault occurrences, protection challenges and ramifications due to undetected faults in PV systems. Furthermore, with a widespread literature, the paper critically reviews numerous fault detection algorithms/techniques available for PV systems which are proven to be effective and feasible to implement. The proposed study is not only limited to surveying the existing techniques but also analyzes the performance of each technique with an emphasis on its: 1) Approach, 2) Sensor requirements, 3) Ability to diagnose and localize faults, 4) Integration complexity, 5) Accuracy, 6) Applicability and 7) Implementation cost. Overall, this paper is envisioned to avail the researchers working in the field of PV systems with a valuable resource, which will assist them to enrich their research works.},

   abstract = {The need for the usage of signal processing and pattern recognition techniques to monitor photovoltaic (PV) arrays and to detect and respond to faults with minimal human involvement is increasing. The data obtained from the array can be used to dynamically modify the array topology and improve array power output. This is beneficial especially when module mismatches such as shading, soiling and aging occur in the PV array. A robust statistics-based fault detection algorithm to find faulty modules is presented. Further, topology optimization of PV arrays using module level data is considered. Various topologies such as the series-parallel (SP), the total cross-tied (TCT), the bridge link (BL) and their bypassed versions are considered. The performance associated with these topologies for a possible shading pattern is analyzed and a topology reconfiguration algorithm is employed to find an optimal configuration. The results demonstrate the benefit of having an electrically re-configurable array topology. Results were generated in a SPICE simulator using synthetic and real data obtained from the APS experimental PV array facility. © 2012 IEEE.},

The paper discusses both the transient response and post-fault behavior of the PV system (DC side), including PV array, overcurrent protection devices (OCPD, i.e. fuses) and grid-connected PV inverter. The experimental results demonstrate that fault locations and the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) may significantly reduce the fault current magnitude so that the fault is not detectable by OCPD. To eliminate the protection 'blind spot,' statistic outlier detection rules are applied on the PV-string monitoring system, but sometimes they may cause false alarms. To address this issue, the local outlier factor (LOF) is developed in PV installations that shows improved fault detection. In experimental results, the proposed method demonstrates several advantages over traditional PV monitoring systems, such as simplicity, quick response, easy implementation and no requirement of weather information. The limitations of the proposed method are also discussed.},
