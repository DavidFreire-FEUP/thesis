   abstract = {Solar energy has increased in its share of global electrical energy production. The increasing reliability of solar energy has positively affected the sustainability of photovoltaic (PV) power plants. A failure in any module in the plant can reduce or interrupt the production of electrical energy, causing significant losses in both efficiency and asset value. Therefore, responding to a fault as quickly as possible in a PV power plant is critical. The ability of the PV plant operator to react to potential faults is directly related to the rapid detection of faulty modules. In this paper, different PV monitoring systems in the literature are investigated extensively from the point of view of the devices and the techniques used to measure PV systems' current, voltage, solar radiation, and module temperature. In particular, the communication methods and data acquisition cards used in monitoring were examined. Remote monitoring technologies quickly detect the location of a malfunction in a large-scale power plant. In this context, traditional wire communication methods, today's communication technologies, and the low-cost IoT (Internet of Things) technologies used to monitor the performance of large and small-scale PV power plants are compared in detail. With the advancement of Internet of Things technologies such as Zigbee and LoRa, research on remote wireless monitoring of photovoltaic modules has accelerated in recent years. These technologies are projected to be widely deployed in the near future for the maintenance and fault detection of numerous photovoltaic installations.},

Further, topology optimization of PV arrays using module level data is considered. Various topologies such as the series-parallel (SP), the total cross-tied (TCT), the bridge link (BL) and their bypassed versions are considered. The performance associated with these topologies for a possible shading pattern is analyzed and a topology reconfiguration algorithm is employed to find an optimal configuration.

The paper discusses both the transient response and post-fault behavior of the PV system (DC side), including PV array, overcurrent protection devices (OCPD, i.e. fuses) and grid-connected PV inverter. The experimental results demonstrate that fault locations and the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) may significantly reduce the fault current magnitude so that the fault is not detectable by OCPD. To eliminate the protection 'blind spot,' statistic outlier detection rules are applied on the PV-string monitoring system, but sometimes they may cause false alarms. To address this issue, the local outlier factor (LOF) is developed in PV installations that shows improved fault detection. In experimental results, the proposed method demonstrates several advantages over traditional PV monitoring systems, such as simplicity, quick response, easy implementation and no requirement of weather information. The limitations of the proposed method are also discussed.},

Photovoltaic (PV) systems and specifically one-axis solar trackers are the most used type of installations in solar power plants. Those solar trackers are slender structures installed in open-air areas sometimes subjected to high speed winds. During the last years, failures in these structures are starting to appear, and most of them are related to a dynamic phenomenon called torsional galloping. The torsional galloping is an aeroelastic instability that presents very high deformation amplitudes and can be triggered at certain wind speeds and tilt angles of the solar tracker. In this paper, a failure investigation of a solar tracker due to torsional galloping is carried out. The broken structure has been analyzed in the field and a numerical model of the structure has been built up. The numerical model is used to identify the natural frequencies of the structure as well as the maximum stresses in the different pieces of the solar tracker. The numerical investigation confirmed that the cause of the failure was torsional galloping occurring for high speed winds and with a tilt angle of the solar tracker of 0 degrees.},

   abstract = {Photovoltaic power plants nowadays play an important role in the context of energy generation based on renewable sources. With the purpose of obtaining maximum efficiency, the PV modules of these power plants are installed in trackers. However, the mobile structure of the trackers is subject to faults, which can compromise the desired perpendicular position between the PV modules and the brightest point in the sky. So, the diagnosis of a fault in the trackers is fundamental to ensure the maximum energy production. Approaches based on sensors and statistical methods have been researched but they are expensive and time consuming. To overcome these problems, a new method is proposed for the fault diagnosis in the trackers of the PV systems based on a machine learning approach. In this type of approach the developed method can be classified into two major categories: supervised and unsupervised. In accordance with this, to implement the desired fault diagnosis, an unsupervised method based on a new image processing algorithm to determine the PV slopes is proposed. The fault detection is obtained comparing the slopes of several modules. This algorithm is based on a new image processing approach in which principal component analysis (PCA) is used. Instead of using the PCA to reduce the data dimension, as is usual, it is proposed to use it to determine the slope of an object. The use of the proposed approach presents several benefits, namely, avoiding the use of a wide range of data and specific sensors, fast detection and reliability even with incomplete images due to reflections and other problems. Based on this algorithm, a deviation index is also proposed that will be used to discriminate the panel(s) under fault. Several test cases are used to test and validate the proposed approach. From the obtained results, it is possible to verify that the PCA can successfully be adapted and used in image processing algorithms to determine the slope of the PV modules and so effectively detect a fault in the tracker, even when there are incomplete parts of an object in the image.},

Dynamic cloud movement, shading and soiling, lead to fluctuations in power output and loss of efficiency. For optimization of output power, a cloud movement prediction algorithm is proposed. Integrated fault detection methods are also described to predict and by pass failing modules. Finally, the fully connected solar array, which is fitted with multiple sensors, is operated as an Internet of things network. Integrated with each module are sensors and radio electronics communicating all data to a fusion center. Gathering data at the fusion center to compute and transmit analytics requires secure low power communication solutions.

@article{Aziz2020,
   abstract = {Fault diagnosis in photovoltaic (PV) arrays is essential in enhancing power output as well as the useful life span of a PV system. Severe faults such as Partial Shading (PS) and high impedance faults, low location mismatch, and the presence of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) make fault detection challenging in harsh environmental conditions. In this regard, there have been several attempts made by various researchers to identify PV array faults. However, most of the previous work has focused on fault detection and classification in only a few faulty scenarios. This paper presents a novel approach that utilizes deep two-dimensional (2-D) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract features from 2-D scalograms generated from PV system data in order to effectively detect and classify PV system faults. An in-depth quantitative evaluation of the proposed approach is presented and compared with previous classification methods for PV array faults-both classical machine learning based and deep learning based. Unlike contemporary work, five different faulty cases (including faults in PS-on which no work has been done before in the machine learning domain) have been considered in our study, along with the incorporation of MPPT. We generate a consistent dataset over which to compare ours and previous approaches, to make for the first (to the best of our knowledge) comprehensive and meaningful comparative evaluation of fault diagnosis. It is observed that the proposed method involving fine-tuned pre-trained CNN outperforms existing techniques, achieving a high fault detection accuracy of 73.53%. Our study also highlights the importance of representative and discriminative features to classify faults (as opposed to the use of raw data), especially in the noisy scenario, where our method achieves the best performance of 70.45%. We believe that our work will serve to guide future research in PV system fault diagnosis.},

   abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems in the power grids. Although PV systems provide the grid with clean and renewable energy, their unsafe and inefficient operation can affect the grid reliability. Early stage fault detection plays a crucial role in reducing the operation and maintenance costs and provides a long lifespan for PV arrays. PV Fault detection, however, is challenging especially when DC short circuit occurs under the low irradiance conditions while the arrays are equipped with an active maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mechanism. In this case, the efficiency and power output of a PV array decrease significantly under hard-to-detect faults such as active MPPT and low irradiance. If the hard-to-detect faults are not detected effectively, they will lead to PV array damage and potential fire hazard. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a new sparse representation classifier (SRC) based on feature extraction to effectively detect DC short circuit faults of PV array. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed SRC fault detection method, we use numerical simulation and compare its performance with the artificial neural network (ANN) based fault detection.},

Different statistical and comparative approaches have already been proposed in the literature for fault detection; however, accurate classification of fault and loss incidents based on PV performance time series remains a key challenge. Failure diagnosis and trend-based performance loss routines were developed in this work for detecting PV underperformance and accurately identifying the different fault types and loss mechanisms. The proposed routines focus mainly on the differentiation of failures (e.g., inverter faults) from irreversible (e.g., degradation) and reversible (e.g., snow and soiling) performance loss factors based on statistical analysis. The proposed routines were benchmarked using historical inverter data obtained from a 1.8 MWp PV power plant. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the routines for detecting failures and loss mechanisms and the capability of the pipeline for distinguishing underperformance issues using anomaly detection and change-point (CP) models. Finally, a CP model was used to extract significant changes in time series data, to detect soiling and cleaning events and to estimate both the performance loss and degradation rates of fielded PV systems.},
