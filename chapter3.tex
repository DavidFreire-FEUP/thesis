% Academic and industrial setting and data source
\section{Academic and Industrial Setting}

The present work unrolls at Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto by a student who is also an employee of Enlitia \cite{EL}. Therefore, we consider academic and industrial standards during the development of the tool. One of the employer's requirements is to formulate it in the Python programming language \cite{Python}.

Having the possibility of working with a company that provides artificial intelligence solutions for energy systems, there is ample availability of PV asset data from various clients, mainly from the Iberian Peninsula and other European countries. There will be a need to gather information from assets with historical significance and with the presence of faults., which were quite accessible. Although Enlitia leases PV asset data for this work, its origin will remain classified.

Figure \ref{fig:gantt} represents the expected chronological sequence of events. The most uncertainty comes from adapting the formulation of the methodology and developing a Python application that implements its behavior, given that it is an entirely new approach.
%There is also some doubt about the work time required to upscale the experimental environment toward actual deployment, knowing that the empirical setting of data science experiments may radically differ from software production environments. There will be an attempt to match the development environment with the implementation context, reducing the latter's risk.

% Document structure
According to the predefined workflow, the following chapters of this document will include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Formulation of the novel approach to anomaly detection.
    \item The process of data gathering, defining data sources, and available information on our PV case study.
    \item Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data mining.
    \item Setup context for the small-scale experiment: dataset construction, data cleaning, tool configuration.
    \item Simulating the tool.
    \item Result validation.
\end{itemize}

% Strategies
\section{Development strategies}

We will gather data by combining different sources, such as power meters and SCADA measurements, local meteorological stations, and satellite data. We will examine data availability, quality, and time resolution, among other factors. However, we will not disclose the actual sources due to privacy concerns.

To implement the proposed tool, we will use Python as well as some of its libraries, such as Pandas \cite{pandas}, Numpy \cite{numpy}, Scikit-learn \cite{sklearn}, and SciPy \cite{scipy}. They facilitated working with large volumes of data and have some built-in practical scientific algorithms. 

Software engineering guidelines will rule the software architecture of the final application, which should follow its well-studied organization patterns. Even though it is not a focus of this work, paying attention to code implementation should result in better code, scalability, and security.

% Final product

\section{Final expectations}

The final application aims to implement online fault detection for operational PV assets. It will be as generalized as possible, as that would increase its correct functioning for different PV assets of various plant operators, as well as other systems. In the end, we expect to have the usability and robustness of a finished software product so that PV plant operators can reliably utilize its outputs.

% \chapter{Conclusions}

% Given the current state of investment in grid-connected big-scale photovoltaic systems, it's known that resource allocation to fault recovery is essential to meet grid code requirements, safety, and health standards, reduce investment risk and maximize the asset's throughput. The literature supported this claim by presenting extensive research on fault detection and classification in PV systems. These works have utilized various methodologies ranging from image-based to electrical-based approaches and incorporated techniques such as signal processing, graph theory, statistics, machine learning, deep learning, and even quantum machine learning. Different authors have used the same dataset and small-scale research facility, providing some data consistency across multiple studies. However, many have also relied on synthetic validation data with unrealistic operating scenarios. To combat this issue, and since this work encompasses PV systems with differing characteristics from most (utility-scale instead of small-scale or simulated), the development phase will cover a comparative analysis of some of the most relevant methodologies utilizing a common (and realistic) dataset. Finally, it aims to develop a novel approach to fault detection and classification in PV systems using contemporary deep learning techniques (CXN). The results of this research will contribute to a better understanding of fault occurrence and accurate fault classification in PV systems, supporting their growth as a reliable and efficient renewable energy source.
