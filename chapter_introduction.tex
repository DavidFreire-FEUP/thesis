\section{Contextualization}

The XIX century represents a substantial change to how the world percieves energy resources,
characterized by the urge to invest in renewable energy sources to power modern societies.
These relatively modern alternatives are proving to be cost efficient and environmentally friendly...

\section{Motivation}
Given the wide spread increase in construction of PV (Photovoltaic) farms, there comes a need 
to maintain these facilities operational and yeilding at their maximum efficiency.
For that to be achieved, a series of routines must be executed in order to
maintain the state estimation of a farm, as it is desirable to know if any action must be taken to
restore or fix components from a faulty scenario.

\section{Objectives}

The main scope of this paper is to apply deep learning techniques to diagnose the operation of PV farms.
It is desired to achieve the following:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Identify and study the existing tools
  \item Adapt and/or develop a new tool based on distributed architecture AI
  \item Apply and test the new tool on a real case study
  \item Validate methodologies through benchmarking and reference tools
\end{itemize}
